# Sample application

This is the sample application detailed in the Ruby on Rails Tutorial book. Following this tutorial I've learned about models, views, controllers, templates, partials, filters, validations, callbacks, has_many/belongs_to and has_many :through associations, security, testing using MiniTest, and deployment using Heroku.
